# AI Age Verification System

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered age verification system** that estimates a user’s age from an uploaded image or webcam input.  
It is designed to provide a proof-of-concept for age-gated applications such as online marketplaces, gaming, or content access.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This system is a demonstration project and not a production-ready security solution.
